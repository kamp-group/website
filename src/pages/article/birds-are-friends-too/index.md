Birdwatching is the art of noticing birds and sometimes correctly identifying them. I like it as a hobby because it's, if we're being honest, completely pointless and will never "amount to anything". It's liberating in that way. I don't have to be good at it, I can't monetize it. I just want to be in the presence of birds.

Why birds? Above all, because there are so many and they are all so distinct. If you go hiking, you might see one or two mammals. But you could potentially see 40 species of birds! That's so many kinds of birds! And they all behave in delightful, surprising, different ways. It is a joy to see a wren sing, or a raven scavenge, or an owl stare back at you. Birdwatching is maybe the easiest way to witness the diversity and intelligence of nature.

But that diversity can also be a source of confusion: just how do you start memorizing the 10,000 species of birds? Even if you know all the birds, how can you identify a bird in the wild when it's far away, or moving quickly, or you can only hear it? Truthfully it takes time and it's an ongoing process. The study of birds never quite ends, but it's rewarding. So in no particular order, here are the various study tools available to you. There's no "correct" path through birdwatching, so use any or all of these whenever you want. 

##Books
Books are absolutely the best resource for birdwatching. Ideally you want a book with lots of illustrations, as scientific illustrations help show what the birds generally look like whereas photos can only show the peculiarities of individual birds. Since birds often have different feather patterns based on sex and age, you want books that show these as well. The [Sibley guides](https://www.sibleyguides.com/product-category/books/) are fantastic and what I personally use.

When you get a birding book, it's helpful to take a quick skim through it and see if there are already birds you can identify. Crows, pigeons, and robins might be a good place to start. Read about the "birding" way of identifying them (body size, eye color, wingspan, etc) and start noticing those features in other birds too. Familiarize yourself with the different categories of birds: you have shorebirds near large bodies of water, you have social and curious corvids near human activity, you have solitary raptors perched high above the ground... Being able to identify the type of bird based on location and behavior will help you quickly find the right section in your book to pinpoint exactly what species of bird you just saw.

##Apps
The [Audubon Bird Guide App](https://www.audubon.org/app) is a lovely complement to books. You can even start with the app instead of books to save money (though this app assumes a certain amount of comfort with birding vocabulary already). The app has a "Bird ID" feature that allows you to search for birds based on location, size, color, song, and anything else you may have noticed. This is what I use when I'm out in the field and don't have my bird books with me. I highly recommend it!

##Classes
Ultimately nothing has been as beneficial to me as taking birdwatching classes. Being out in the field with an expert is incredible: they'll help you notice what to notice, and they'll be able to answer all the questions you have. I've taken a class at the local city college, attended birdwatching tours at the botanical garden, and found more trips through the local Audubon branch. These are usually free or at least affordable, since capitalism has yet to ruin birdwatching, and they're a lot of fun! They're great too if you don't have your own binoculars yet and just want to borrow someone else's. 

##In the Field
Eventually you'll be out there in nature on your own, looking at birds, with no one to tell you what's what. This is ultimately what all that studying was about: being capable of identifying birds yourself. You may still have a book or an app with you, but the more studying you do the less you'll need to refer to these. It's only by walking outside and attuning myself to the birds around me that I've become able to identify some of them instantly. And really, this is the best part. 

To step outside early in the morning, surrounded by bird song, watching birds soar or hop or flutter, and recognizing them as you would a close friend is a simple and beautiful joy. These birds have always been here in our lives and it's high time we started getting to know them. Even the single ability of identifying a crow from a raven has made me much more observant. Birds are no longer a vague homogenous group of "wingy things". They are as distinct as people. So too have the flowers and trees started disguishing themselves, and the rocks, the clouds, the insects. I no longer feel separate from nature but rather intimately part of it. Which, of course, we all are. So perhaps that's really the best reason to start birdwatching: to remind yourself that a sparrow is as much a part of the world as you are, and time spent appreciating its song is time well-spent.

Happy birdwatching~
