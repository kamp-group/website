Birdwatching is the art of watching birds and sometimes correctly identifying them. I like it as a hobby because it's, if we're being honest, completely pointless and will never "amount to anything". It's liberating in that way. I don't have to be good at it, I can't monetize it. I just want to look at birds.

Why birds? Above all, because there are so many and they are all so distinct. If you go hiking, you might at best see one or two mammals. But you could potentially see 20 species of birds! That's so many kinds of birds! And they all live in delightful, surprising, tender, different ways. It is a joy to see a wren sing, or a raven scavenge, or an owl stare back at you. Birdwatching is maybe the easiest way to witness the diversity and intelligence of nature.

But that diversity can also be a source of confusion: just how do you start memorizing the 10,000 species of birds? How can you walk outside, hear the faintest little chirp, and immediately identify the bird? How can you see a flash of black and brown in the sky and know what flew overhead?

One bird at a time, my friend.

You can already identify some birds. You know what a pigeon is. That's 1! You know about crows, and possibly how they differ from ravens: let's say that's 3! Perhaps a robin, or a blue jay? A flamingo? A bald eagle? That's like 7 birds right there. You're doing awesome so far at knowing birds!

Of course, you probably won't see all of these in the exact same place. You're more interested in the birds around you. The easiest way to start identifying those is with the [Audubon Bird Guide App](https://www.audubon.org/app). They have a "Bird ID" feature that allows you to search for birds based on location, size, color, song... anything you may have noticed. This is what I use when I'm out in the field and don't have my bird books with me, and I highly recommend it!

The app becomes more useful however if you've already familiarized yourself with certain types of birds and have a good grasp of what to look for. You often only get a few seconds to see a bird, and even then it may be far away.
